/**
 * Zero-Knowledge Proof Library for Verifiable Credentials
 * 
 * This library provides Groth16 SNARK operations for proving knowledge
 * of a valid Verifiable Credential without revealing its contents.
 * 
 * Circuit: proves that a VC is signed by a trusted Issuer and is valid
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   1. Call ZK_Init() once to setup proving/verifying keys
 *   2. Prover: ZK_ComputeVCHash() + ZK_GenerateVCProof()
 *   3. Verifier: ZK_VerifyVCProof()
 *   4. Call ZK_Cleanup() when done
